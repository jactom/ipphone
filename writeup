Challenges.
The major challenge was learning the pulse audio api. Since we have already
done socket programming, the focus was to obtain the sampled audio data from
mic and play the audio data from network. The pulse audio api has two
interfaces, the simple and asynchronous. For our purpose the simple api was
enough. Once succeeded in capturing and playing the audio, the basic ip phone
was implemented using sockets. 

Future Improvements.
The audio data sent over the network is uncompressed and raw. So the
transmission requires large bandwidth and also not secure. Real time noise
cancellation can improve audio clarity. Also the data sampling should be done
using periodic scheduling rather than using a while loop.
